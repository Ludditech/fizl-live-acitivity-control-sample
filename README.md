# Live Activity Control Module

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the _Live Activity Control Module_ project developed by Fizl.

This module is an [Expo Native Module](https://docs.expo.dev/modules/get-started/#creating-the-local-expo-module) that allows you to control the live activity of the app. Whether you are a beginner or experienced developer, we invite you to follow this article in English[^1] or French[^2], which will explain in detail how to integrate and use the *Live Activity Sample* project in your iOS applications.

## Installation

Create a new Expo project and a new expo module. The copy the files from this repository to the new module. You will need to build your expo project to see the changes. It will only work with development clients and not with Expo Go.

To use the module in your project, use the functions exported from the `index.ts` file. These are the bindings to the native module.

ðŸ’š Ludditech, the company behind Fizl, was named in honor of the 19th-century Luddites, who opposed the use of machines for fear of losing their jobs. With this legacy at the heart of our identity, our deep conviction is that technology should not replace workers, but assist them in realizing their potential â€“ to "become what they aspire to be".
